journaltools guide
===============================

*journaltools* is a collection of useful reference management tools, with a specific focus on peer-reviewed journal articles. It presently supports the identification, downloading and renaming of references, as well as the generation and conversion of bibtex files. I had initially written it for personal use but in the spirit of collaboration figured might also find it of use.
